# upStock

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- I have implemented historical OHLC chart pages using React hooks and Redux.
- Single store is implemented using create Store of redux.
- Charts have been implemented using amcharts (https://www.amcharts.com) 

Thanks :)
